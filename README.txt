Shoot Projectiles Innovation: A secondary projectile that instantly kills the enemy
	Please note, at the moment, this is an easy switch for the player and therefore too easy, but the plan is to make the player work to get this projectile and have it be
	on a random time frame that the player can obtain this projectile
